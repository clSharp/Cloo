[Description]
Cloo is an open source, easy to use, managed library which enables .NET/Mono applications to take full advantage of the OpenCL framework.

[Requirements]
The following is required for Cloo to work properly:
1) OpenCL drivers. Depending on your system, you can obtain them from your graphics device manufacturer website or operating system vendor website.
2) The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.1 SDK.
3) Visual Studio 2017 (15.9.4) with .NET core support enabled
4) .NET Core 2.0 SDK installed

[Download & Install]
You can download the most recent version of Cloo from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloo/". 
The library needs no installation or changes to your system. Just be sure that its files are "visible" to the application.
Note: Putting Cloo into the Global Assembly Cache is not recommended. The versioning schema of the library doesn't follow the Microsoft guidelines. This can cause compatibility problems when Cloo is updated.

[Contact]
You can use the forums at "http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloo/forums" to get help, report bugs or express any wishes.

[Thank You Speech]
I'd like to thank the developers and the community of The Open Toolkit library for their all-time support and precious help.
I'd also like to thank everyone that has bothered to fill in a bug report/feature request, has posted a patch/solution or just dropped a few encouraging lines.
Much appreciated!
